  <div class="section-title">The Genealogy of Jesus Christ</div>

  <div class="verse" onclick="toggleComment('c1')">(1)The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:</div>
<div id="c1" class="comment-box">
  <div class="comment-label">üí¨ Notes Verse 1:</div>
  1:1 Jesus means ‚ÄúO Lord, save,‚Äù referring to His role as Savior (v. 21). Christ means ‚ÄúAnointed One,‚Äù the <br>
  Messiah, the One who is filled with the Holy Spirit (see Jn 1:33). Though the Son alone became Man, God <br>
  the Father and the Holy Spirit work in Jesus Christ to save us. Jesus became Man as a Jew, from the <br>
  lineage of Abraham, the father of all Jews, and of David, Israel‚Äôs greatest king and the prototype of the <br>
  royal Messiah. This genealogy reveals that the Son of God so identifies with the human condition that He <br>
  takes it all on Himself and becomes part of it. Christ's ancestry includes both righteous and wicked <br>
  people, faithful kings and murderers, Jews and Gentiles, kings and peasants.</p>
</div>


<div class="verse">(2)Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.</div>
<div class="verse">(3)Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram.</div>
<div class="verse">(4)Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon.</div>
<div class="verse">(5)Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,</div>
<div class="verse">(6)and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</div>
<div class="verse">(7)Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.</div>
<div class="verse">(8)Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.</div>
<div class="verse">(9)Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.</div>
<div class="verse">(10)Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.</div>
<div class="verse">(11)Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.</div>
<div class="verse">(12)And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.</div>
<div class="verse">(13)Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.</div>
<div class="verse">(14)Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.</div>
<div class="verse">(15)Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.</div>
<div class="verse">(16)And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.</div>
<div class="verse">(17)So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.</div>

<div class="section-title">Christ Born of Mary</div>
<div class="verse">(18)Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</div>
<div class="verse">(19)Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.</div>
<div class="verse">(20)But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ‚ÄúJoseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. </div>
<div class="verse">(21)And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.‚Äù </div>
<div class="verse">(22)So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:</div>
<div class="verse">(23)‚ÄúBehold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,‚Äù which is translated, ‚ÄúGod with us.‚Äù</div>
<div class="verse">(24)Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,</div>
<div class="verse">(25)and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus.</div>
