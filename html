  <div class="comment-label">üí¨ Notes Verse 1:</div>
  1:1 Jesus means ‚ÄúO Lord, save,‚Äù referring to His role as Savior (v. 21). Christ means ‚ÄúAnointed One,‚Äù the <br>
  Messiah, the One who is filled with the Holy Spirit (see Jn 1:33). Though the Son alone became Man, God <br>
  the Father and the Holy Spirit work in Jesus Christ to save us. Jesus became Man as a Jew, from the <br>
  lineage of Abraham, the father of all Jews, and of David, Israel‚Äôs greatest king and the prototype of the <br>
  royal Messiah. This genealogy reveals that the Son of God so identifies with the human condition that He <br>
  takes it all on Himself and becomes part of it. Christ's ancestry includes both righteous and wicked <br>
  people, faithful kings and murderers, Jews and Gentiles, kings and peasants.</p>
