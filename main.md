## The Genealogy of Jesus Christ

**(1)The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham ☦**

> 💬 Notes Verse 1:  
> 1:1 Jesus means “O Lord, save,” referring to His role as Savior (v. 21). Christ means “Anointed One,” the Messiah, the One who is filled with the Holy Spirit (see Jn 1:33). Though the Son alone became Man, God the Father and the Holy Spirit work in Jesus Christ to save us. Jesus became Man as a Jew, from the lineage of Abraham, the father of all Jews, and of David, Israel’s greatest king and the prototype of the royal Messiah. This genealogy reveals that the Son of God so identifies with the human condition that He takes it all on Himself and becomes part of it. Christ's ancestry includes both righteous and wicked people, faithful kings and murderers, Jews and Gentiles, kings and peasants.

**(2)Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers ☦**

> 💬 Notes Verse 2:  
> While Luke’s genealogy runs from Jesus back to Adam (Lk 3:23-38), Matthew's list descends from Abraham, with whom God established the Old Covenant of circumcision, to Jesus, the author of the New Covenant. God promised to bless all the tribes of the earth in Abraham (Gn 12:3; 28:14); this promise is fulfilled in Abraham’s greatest Son, Jesus Christ.

**(3)Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram ☦**

> 💬 Notes Verse 3:  
> 1:3 Jewish genealogical lists normally included only men. The mention of women (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) is unusual. Each one was either a Gentile or a sinner. The inclusion of these women declares God's graciousness and prefigures the calling of Gentiles into the Church. It also underscores the role of women in God's plan of salvation and anticipates the special place of the Virgin Mary in that plan.

**(4)Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon**  
**(5)Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse**  

**(6)and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah ☦**

> 💬 Notes Verse 6:  
> 1:6 Through anointing by Samuel, David was made king. Through his psalms, David was revealed as a great prophet. Thus, David foreshadows both the royal and the prophetic nature of Jesus Christ (Ps 109). As an adulterer and a murderer, David also functions as a type for all repentant sinners.

## Christ Born of Mary

**(18)Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit**  

**(19)Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly ☦**

> 💬 Notes Verse 19:  
> 1:19 The righteousness of Joseph consisted of a mercy that transcends the Law (Hos 6:6). Joseph showed this mercy by his unwillingness to expose Mary’s supposed sin, even though he was obliged by the Law to do so. Her husband: The Bible calls engaged couples husband and wife before their marriage (Rachel was called the wife of Jacob before marriage by virtue of their engagement in Gn 29:21; see also Dt 22:23, 24). Thus, Joseph is called the husband of Mary, and Mary is called his wife (vv. 20, 24). In the Church, Joseph is remembered as the Betrothed, pointing out Mary's ever-virginity. (See also note on Est 2:7.)
